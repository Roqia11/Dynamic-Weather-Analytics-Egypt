## üå§Ô∏è Dynamic-Weather-Analytics-Egypt|Power BI

This project showcases an interactive weather dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes weather data across six major Egyptian cities: **Cairo, 6th of October, Alexandria, Benha, Fayoum, and Luxor**.

The goal is to provide clear and meaningful insights into key weather metrics such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **wind speed**, using intuitive visuals and filters that help users explore and compare data easily.

### üîç Dashboard Features:
- **KPI Cards** for quick metrics (avg. temperature, humidity, wind)
- **Bar Chart** comparing weather values across cities
- **Map Visualization** showing city-based weather
- **Slicers** for selecting city and date range
- **Data Table** for daily weather records

This dashboard helps users quickly understand climate conditions in each city. It can be useful for students, researchers, travelers, or anyone interested in comparing weather trends across different regions of Egypt.

The data was prepared and cleaned using Excel and loaded into Power BI for modeling and visualization. DAX was used to create dynamic measures and calculated fields.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used:
